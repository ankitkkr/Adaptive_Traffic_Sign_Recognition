# Adaptive_Traffic_Sign_Recognizer
Traffic Signs Recognition using CNN and TensorFlow (Keras) in Python


## About the Project

The main objective of our project is to design and construct a computer-based system that can automatically detect the road signs so as to provide assistance to the user or the machine so that they can take appropriate actions. The proposed approach consists of building a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

Our approach to building this traffic sign classification model is discussed in four steps:
1.	Explore the dataset
2.	Build a CNN model
3.	Train and validate the model
4.	Test the model with the test dataset
